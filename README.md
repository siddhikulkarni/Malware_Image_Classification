# Malware_Image_Classification
This project employs CNN to classify malware based on their images.

Abstract
Using the malimg dataset of grayscale malware images, the goal of this project is to develop an accurate model for categorizing different types of malware. By leveraging shared visual characteristics, the approach represents malware binaries as grayscale images and groups similar types of malware based on layout and texture similarities within families.

Key Features
Malware image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Dataset preprocessing and augmentation techniques
Baseline Logistic Regression (LR) model for comparison
Evaluation metrics for performance analysis
Heatmap visualization for interpretability and explainability
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)


Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
We used an altered version of the malimg dataset, which includes labeled malware samples. It has been augmented with non-malware images to create a ”normal” class. This enabled comprehensive evaluation of the models’ performance. The malimg dataset contains grayscale images of malware binaries from 25 different families. Each image is a 32x32 byteplot representation of the malware. The altered malimg dataset and additional dataset used for testing can be obtained from the following sources:

Additional Dataset
Usage
Prepare the dataset by following the instructions provided in the repository.
Run the main.py file to train and evaluate the models: python main.py
Results
The trained CNN model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the testing set, outperforming the baseline Logistic Regression model. Heatmaps were generated to visualize important regions in the images that contribute to the model's predictions.
